        <h3>These are my pet birds. The first one is a male and his name
     is Fuzdoq. Fuzdoq is an arabic word and it means Pistachio
     and we named him this because he looks like a Pistachio!🥜 Fuzdoq has stayed with us around 2 years and he is so cute and loveable! He bites a little bit but we forgive him. The second one is a female bird which is so cute and her colors are white and blue. We named her Loza, which in english means Almonds. We named her this because when you break the Almond in a half, it is white! They both play, fight, eat, and sleep with each other just like best friends. And what is so good about them is that they are handfed, which means that you can make them stand on your hands! Who knows, maybe they will bring for us baby birds, and that will be so cute!🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️</h3>

            FUN FACTS ABOUT MY BIRDS:
      
            <ol>
                <li>We bought Fuzdoq from a store and he was only $35!!!</li>
                <li>Loza was much more priceful since we bought her handfed (We had to train Fuzdoq so he can be handfed)</li>
                <img src="Facts.gif" alt="Thumbs up">
                <li>When we travel, we give our birds to my dad's friend and he takes care of them. He is good with birds since he owns two lovebirds with him at home!</li>
                <li>We think that who made Fuzdoq bite is that the lovebirds made him do that and trained him (And Fuzdoq is the one who told Loza!)</li>
                <li>Birds age are 10 times our age. So Fuzdoq is like 15 years and Loza is like 6 years!</li>
                <li>Birds can live with you up to 15 16 years, then they may die.</li>
                <li>There are too many kinds of birds, and ours are called budgies. There are parrots, lovebirds, zebra birds, and more!!!</li>

                Why are birds the top and best pets to have?<br>
                <br>Birds are the best pets or one of the best pets because they look cute and easy to clean and take care of them. Also, pets like dogs are dangerous, and they are hard to clean. Also their salaiva is disgusting, and they may bite you if you scare them, or on the first day to be with them. Also they are noisy and can mess your house.🐶Now for cats, they are cute, amazing, and nice, but they might also scratch if you scare them, while the small kinds of birds like budgies' bites don't hurt at all🐱. Fishes are good and amazing to look at, and I tried 2 fishes in my life, but they have two main problems. The first one and the most hateful one is that they die quickly and easily since they are super sensible. The second thing is that you cannot play with them, you can only watch them like cartoons. How boring!🐟There are more pets that I still didn't mention, but I think birds are the best. Everyone have their one feelings about animals, and everyone should like their own feelings.🥰🥰🥰

                How to train a bird on you?<br>
                <br>As I said before, birds can be handfed or not handfed. Handfed means they are trained for humans, while others cannot. So you can buy birds that are handfed, but they cost too much. But you can also train the birds that are not handfed on you. On the first and second day, leave them alone, whether it's handfed or not. Then you start sitting beside it calmly, don't scare it, and don't get a lot of people beside it, only one. Then after 3 weeks, you can start opening the door of the cage and put the best food for birds far away from it while you holding it. It will start eating it, but make sure to not get your hands close to it. Also make sure to make only one person to train it, not a couple, after 6 months, you can start making other people training it. You start getting your hands closer and closer and then after 2-3 months, they will start standing on you hands. After that, start training them for a couple of more months until when they are used to you, you can take them out of their cage. Make sure to put things in your house for them to stand on, so if they fly, they can stand on something. And then you start training it on other people.🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑🏽‍🤝‍👨
